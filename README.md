# JetSetGo
JetSetGo is a Java-based Android travel app with flight booking and AI-driven exploration. It features 'Wander Points' using targeted AI logic for meaningful navigation, replacing random movement with predefined travel spots. Built in Android Studio (Java) with scalable UI, it serves as a smart travel companion.

Based on our previous conversations, here is the **project description for your app JetSetGo**:

### **Project Title:** JetSetGo – Travel Companion App

### **Project Description:**

JetSetGo is a mobile travel guide application developed to enhance the experience of travelers by integrating essential features like flight booking and exploration assistance. The app aims to serve as a one-stop travel solution where users can plan and manage their trips efficiently. A standout feature is the **'Wander Points'** system, powered by AI logic that allows characters (or virtual agents) to wander intelligently by navigating predefined landmarks rather than random locations, adding a layer of realism and purpose to AI behavior in the app's interactive elements.

### **Project Scope:**

* **Flight Booking Page:** Users can browse and book flights directly through the app.
* **Wander Points Mechanism:** Uses AI to search and target specific 'wander points' instead of relying on random travel paths, making exploration recommendations more meaningful.
* **Tour Guide Feature (planned/future scope):** Provide AI-guided recommendations for travel spots, accommodations, and local experiences.

### **Technologies and Tools Used:**

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Platform:** Android
* **Framework:** Android SDK
* **AI Logic Implementation:** Utilized UE4-style logic (inspired by Unreal Engine AI behavior) — replacing random radius-based movement (`GetRandomPointInRadius`) with targeted logic via `GetAllActors` to identify known locations for wandering.
* **UI Design:** XML-based Android Layouts
* **Development Environment:** Android Studio

### **Key Features:**

* Efficient and user-friendly flight booking interface
* AI-powered exploration logic for destination discovery
* Modular code architecture for future scalability
* Potential to integrate GPS, maps API, or cultural site databases
